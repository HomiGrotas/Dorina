Welcome to the Dorina project!

Requirements:
1.) main.asm
2.) compile.bat 							(for tasm and tlink, gets filename as argument)
3.) code file to run							(can be one of the demos)

Running instructions:
1. Make sure you have all the requirements
2. Place the code file in the same directory as the main.asm is
3. Compile 'main' with compile.bat 					('compile main'), (If you're afraid to use compile.bat, you can write the following commands instead: 'tasm /zi main', 'tlink /v main')
5. Type 'main' and press ENTER
6. Congrats! The project is running!
7. After the intro is printed to the screen, enter a file name with .txt extension and press ENTER		(you can delete mistyped chars)


Coding instructions:
1. Look for available commands at https://github.com/HomiGrotas/Dorina
2. Notice, there should be a blank line only at the end of the code file
3. Notice, there shouldn't be spaces at end of a line 			(PEP8 check will help you- http://pep8online.com/)

Good Luck!
