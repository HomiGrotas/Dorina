# Dorina programming language
Simple programming language with assembly interpeter and python interpeter.
This is the final project of my assembly learning.

## Stages:
* design the language - Done
* build a python interpeter - Done
* build an assembly interpeter based on the python version

## Goal:
 The goal of this project is to build an assembly interpreter for the programming language I made (Dorina).
 This project is for my Magen grade.
